        <p>
          Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities' resilience, our
          design team reimagined the California Grizzly and used it to create
          custom tees, pins and posters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters will be
          available for purchase at our exclusive pop-up shop during our SF
          Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose what
          amount to donate. All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to
          help the communities that are still displaced.

            This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome
            difficult situations and come out stronger than before. It's a flip
            of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California
            poppy.

            This design is inspired by the quote 'grow through what you go
            through' and represents the strength of Californians and how we will
            continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
